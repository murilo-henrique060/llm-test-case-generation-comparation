# 1. The classes User and UserService are imported from the system module.
# 2. Since the implementation is not provided, we assume the existence of these classes
#    for the tests to be syntactically valid.
# 3. We assume the UserService maintains state for the duration of the test instance 
#    to validate BR04 (Duplicate emails).

# Mocking the SUT (System Under Test) strictly for the purpose of test structure validity
# in a real scenario, these would be imported: "from system import UserService, User"
