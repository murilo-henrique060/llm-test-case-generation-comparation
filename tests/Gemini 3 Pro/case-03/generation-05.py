Based on your specifications, here is the `pytest` suite.

These tests assume the existence of a `Subscription` class and a `Payment` class as defined in your context. Since the class diagram was simplified but BR05 requires date validation, the tests explicitly provide a `payment_date` to the `Payment` constructor to satisfy the testability of that rule.
