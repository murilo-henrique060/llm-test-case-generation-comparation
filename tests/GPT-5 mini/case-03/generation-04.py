# The system under test is expected to provide these classes with the documented interface.
# Tests assume:
# - subscription.Subscription() can be constructed (optionally with a status argument)
# - subscription.Payment(success: bool, billing_date: date = None) may be constructed (billing_date used only where BR05 applies)
# - Subscription.record_payment(payment: Payment) exists and returns a Decimal
# - Subscription.status is one of "ACTIVE", "SUSPENDED", "CANCELED"
# - Subscription.payment_failures is an int
# These tests exercise behaviors described in the specification only.
