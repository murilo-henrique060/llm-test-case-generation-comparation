You are a senior test engineer specialized in critical and highly regulated systems.

Your task is to generate automated test cases in Python using exclusively the pytest library,
based on the formal specifications provided below.

⚠️ GENERAL CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

1. Do not create rules, requirements, states, exceptions, or behaviors that are not explicitly described.
2. Do not assume tolerances, rounding, implicit exceptions, or “domain-standard” behaviors.
3. Do not simplify rules or consolidate validations.
4. Clearly distinguish between:
   - validation failure (exception)
   - valid business decision (allowed outcome)
5. Each test must validate exactly one specific behavior.
6. Use precise (exact) values only; never use ranges or generic intervals.
7. All tests must be deterministic and reproducible.
8. Use only pytest, with no additional external libraries.
9. Do not implement the system — tests only.
10. Do not include explanatory text outside code comments.

## SYSTEM CONTEXT

E-commerce Order System, responsible for allowing the creation of orders composed of multiple
items, with total value calculation and discount application according to explicitly defined
business rules.

---

## BUSINESS RULES (BR)

- BR01: An order must contain at least one item;
- BR02: Each item must have a minimum quantity of 1;
- BR03: All items must have a positive price;
- BR04: The total order value is the sum of the items;
- BR05: Orders above R$ 200 receive a 10% discount;
- BR06: The discount must not be applied more than once.

---

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (FR)

- FR01: Create an order with multiple items;
- FR02: Correctly calculate the total;
- FR03: The system must apply the discount correctly when eligible;
- FR04: The system must display the final order value;
- FR05: The system must raise an exception in case of a failure.

+ name: str
+ price: Decimal
+ quantity: int

[Class] Order
+ add_item(item: Item): None
+ calculate_total(): Decimal

## TASK

Based EXCLUSIVELY on the information above:

1. Generate automated tests in Python using pytest.
2. For each Business Rule (BR), create at least one test that:
   - validates correct behavior
   - exposes violations when applicable
3. For each Functional Requirement (FR), create at least one test that:
   - validates its fulfillment
4. Create both positive and negative tests.
5. Create edge case tests whenever explicitly required by the rules.
6. Tests involving exceptions must use pytest.raises.
7. Each test must have a clear and self-explanatory name.
8. Do not reuse tests to cover multiple business rules.
9. Do not use generic parameterization that hides specific scenarios.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

- Return exclusively valid Python code.
- Use the standard pytest structure.
- Each test must include comments explicitly indicating:
  - which BR and/or FR is being validated.

Mandatory comment example:
# BR05 – Orders above R$ 200 receive a 10% discount

---

## EVALUATION CRITERIA (IMPLICIT)

Your response will be evaluated based on:
- Literal adherence to the rules
- Coverage of BR and FR
- Semantic correctness of the tests
- Absence of invented behavior
- Clarity and precision of the generated tests

⚠️ Any test that assumes unspecified behavior will be considered incorrect.

Generate tests only.
