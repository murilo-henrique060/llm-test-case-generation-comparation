You are a senior test engineer specialized in critical and highly regulated systems.

Your task is to generate automated test cases in Python using exclusively the pytest library,
based on the formal specifications provided below.

⚠️ GENERAL CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

1. Do not create rules, requirements, states, exceptions, or behaviors that are not explicitly described.
2. Do not assume tolerances, rounding, implicit exceptions, or “domain-standard” behaviors.
3. Do not simplify rules or consolidate validations.
4. Clearly distinguish between:
   - validation failure (exception)
   - valid business decision (allowed outcome)
5. Each test must validate exactly one specific behavior.
6. Use precise (exact) values only; never use ranges or generic intervals.
7. All tests must be deterministic and reproducible.
8. Use only pytest, with no additional external libraries.
9. Do not implement the system — tests only.
10. Do not include explanatory text outside code comments.

## SYSTEM CONTEXT

User Registration System, responsible for allowing the creation and storage of users containing
name, email, and password. The system must validate basic data integrity rules before allowing
a user to be registered.

---

## BUSINESS RULES (BR)

- BR01: All users must have a name, email, and password;
- BR02: The email must contain the @ character;
- BR03: The password must have at least 6 characters;
- BR04: It is not allowed to register two users with the same email.

---

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (FR)

- FR01: The system must allow registering a user;
- FR02: The system must validate whether the email is valid;
- FR03: The system must prevent registration with a duplicate email;
- FR04: The system must raise an exception in case of a failure.

[Class] User
+ name: str
+ email: str
- password: str

[Class] UserService
+ register(name: str, email: str, password: str) -> User

## TASK

Based EXCLUSIVELY on the information above:

1. Generate automated tests in Python using pytest.
2. For each Business Rule (BR), create at least one test that:
   - validates correct behavior
   - exposes violations when applicable
3. For each Functional Requirement (FR), create at least one test that:
   - validates its fulfillment
4. Create both positive and negative tests.
5. Create edge case tests whenever explicitly required by the rules.
6. Tests involving exceptions must use pytest.raises.
7. Each test must have a clear and self-explanatory name.
8. Do not reuse tests to cover multiple business rules.
9. Do not use generic parameterization that hides specific scenarios.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

- Return exclusively valid Python code.
- Use the standard pytest structure.
- Each test must include comments explicitly indicating:
  - which BR and/or FR is being validated.

Mandatory comment example:
# BR02 – Email must contain the @ character

---

## EVALUATION CRITERIA (IMPLICIT)

Your response will be evaluated based on:
- Literal adherence to the rules
- Coverage of BR and FR
- Semantic correctness of the tests
- Absence of invented behavior
- Clarity and precision of the generated tests

⚠️ Any test that assumes unspecified behavior will be considered incorrect.

Generate tests only.
