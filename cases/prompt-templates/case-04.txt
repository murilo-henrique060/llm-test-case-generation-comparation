You are a senior test engineer specialized in critical and highly regulated systems.

Your task is to generate automated test cases in Python using exclusively the pytest library,
based on the formal specifications provided below.

⚠️ GENERAL CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

1. Do not create rules, requirements, states, exceptions, or behaviors that are not explicitly described.
2. Do not assume tolerances, rounding, implicit exceptions, or “domain-standard” behaviors.
3. Do not simplify rules or consolidate validations.
4. Clearly distinguish between:
   - validation failure (exception)
   - valid business decision (allowed outcome)
5. Each test must validate exactly one specific behavior.
6. Use precise (exact) values only; never use ranges or generic intervals.
7. All tests must be deterministic and reproducible.
8. Use only pytest, with no additional external libraries.
9. Do not implement the system — tests only.
10. Do not include explanatory text outside code comments.

## SYSTEM CONTEXT

Personal credit approval system responsible for evaluating credit applications based
exclusively on the provided score, income, and age values, applying strict validations,
with no inference, normalization, or exposure of intermediate states.

---

## BUSINESS RULES (BR)

- BR01: Credit may only be approved if, simultaneously:
    * Score ≥ 700
    * Income ≥ R$ 5,000
    * Age ≥ 21
- BR02: If any of the criteria fail, the credit must be denied;
- BR03: Values as NaN or Infinity are not allowed and must result in an exception;
- BR04: Criteria must be validated according to the following types and constraints:
    * Score: positive integer value
    * Income: positive decimal value
    * Age: positive integer value
- BR05: Values must not be normalized or implicitly adjusted (e.g., 4999.9999 ≠ 5000);
- BR06: Any validation failure must result in an exception;
- BR07: The system must not infer, guess, or assume values that were not provided;
- BR08: There are no intermediate approval levels;
- BR09: Credit analysis is an indivisible operation:
    * It must not be split into observable steps
    * It must not return partial results
    * It must not expose logs or decision criteria to the API consumer

---

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (FR)

- FR01: Evaluate the credit application using exclusively the provided score, income, and age values, with no inference, normalization, or data enrichment;
- FR02: Mandatory validation of all criteria defined in the business rules before returning any result;
- FR03: Return exclusively one of the following results when all validations are successful: "APPROVED" or "DENIED";
- FR04: Record exactly one analysis result only when a valid decision ("APPROVED" or "DENIED") is produced;
- FR05: Raise an exception whenever any validation failure occurs, including invalid type, missing value, magic value (NaN or Infinity), or business rule violation;
- FR06: Do not return any business result when an exception is raised;
- FR07: Do not expose intermediate states, partial results, or progress messages during or after the analysis;
- FR08: Do not perform any kind of normalization, rounding, or automatic adjustment on input values.

## TASK

Based EXCLUSIVELY on the information above:

1. Generate automated tests in Python using pytest.
2. For each Business Rule (BR), create at least one test that:
   - validates correct behavior
   - exposes violations when applicable
3. For each Functional Requirement (FR), create at least one test that:
   - validates its fulfillment
4. Create both positive and negative tests.
5. Create edge case tests whenever explicitly required by the rules.
6. Tests involving exceptions must use pytest.raises.
7. Each test must have a clear and self-explanatory name.
8. Do not reuse tests to cover multiple business rules.
9. Do not use generic parameterization that hides specific scenarios.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

- Return exclusively valid Python code.
- Use the standard pytest structure.
- Each test must include comments explicitly indicating:
  - which BR and/or FR is being validated.

Mandatory comment example:
# BR05 – Values must not be normalized

---

## EVALUATION CRITERIA (IMPLICIT)

Your response will be evaluated based on:
- Literal adherence to the rules
- Complete coverage of BR and FR
- Semantic correctness of the tests
- Absence of invented behavior
- Clarity and precision of the generated tests

⚠️ Any test that assumes unspecified behavior will be considered incorrect.

Generate tests only.
